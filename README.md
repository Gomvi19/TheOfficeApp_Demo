This Project creates 3 classes SalesPerson, Warehouse, OfficeMnagaer and the main class OfficeApp and allows the user to create object in these classes that can calculate data like how many sales a salesperson has made and at what price
Update paper supply from a warehouse and corganize meetings (this program is based in the universe of the office TV show) 
The expexted inputs from the user include the name of the object they wish to create and all the attributes the objects require, or just create the object without attributes as there are overloaded constructors in every class
